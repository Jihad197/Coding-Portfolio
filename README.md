# Coding Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a showcase of my coding journey across several programming languages. <br>
Here, I collect projects, experiments, and small programs that I have created and learned from during my studies and personal exploration.

## Languages & Tools

I work with multiple programming languages and tools, including:

- **Python** – for simulations, data processing, and visualization  
- **MATLAB** – for numerical methods, physics simulations, and modeling  
- **C** – for algorithms, calculators, and systems programming  
- **Fortran** – for scientific computations and numerical solutions  

I continue to explore and improve my skills in each of these languages.
